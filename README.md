# PROJECT TITLE :  READING-EYE-FOR-A-BLIND-PEOPLE

# PROBLEM STATEMENT :

The objective of this project is to develop a text-to-speech (TTS) system utilizing Tesseract, an optical character recognition (OCR) engine. The aim is to create a seamless and efficient process that takes images containing textual information as input, extracts the text using Tesseract, and then converts the extracted text into spoken words. This system is envisioned to assist individuals with visual impairments by providing them with an auditory representation of the textual content present in images. The challenge involves integrating Tesseract OCR with a suitable text-to-speech synthesis module, optimizing the accuracy of text extraction, and ensuring natural and coherent speech output for a diverse range of input images. Additionally, considerations for real-time processing, scalability, and user interface design may be explored to enhance the overall usability of the proposed Tesseract-based text-to-speech solution."

# PROJECT FLOW:


Data Collection:

 Gather a diverse dataset of text samples that your system will be expected to read aloud. This dataset should cover a range of languages, accents, and styles.

Data Preprocessing:

  Clean and preprocess the text data to remove any irrelevant characters, special symbols, or formatting issues.

Tesseract OCR:

  Use Tesseract to perform OCR on the input text. This step converts the image-based or scanned text into machine-readable text.

Text Processing:

  Process the OCR output to correct errors and enhance the accuracy of the recognized text. This may involve spell checking, grammar correction, and other text processing techniques.

Text-to-Speech Synthesis:

   Select a TTS synthesis model or engine. Popular choices include Google Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, or open-source solutions like Festival or MaryTTS.

Voice Selection:

  Choose a suitable voice for the TTS system. Many TTS engines offer a variety of voices with different accents and characteristics.

Integration:

   Integrate the Tesseract OCR and the selected TTS engine into your application or system. Ensure that the text recognition and speech synthesis components work seamlessly together.

Testing and Evaluation:

  Test the system with various input texts, including challenging cases, to evaluate its performance. Gather user feedback to identify areas for improvement.

Optimization:

  Fine-tune and optimize the system based on user feedback and performance evaluations. This may involve adjusting parameters, updating models, or enhancing the language processing capabilities.
